Direct Style has been all the rage these days: Kotlin and Python have coroutines, and C#/TypeScript have async/await, and the reason is simple: concurrency is hard and we, as programmers, need all the help we can get to make concurrent programming simple and easy to reason about.
Direct Style in Scala is coming as well and using it will not only ease the pain we all suffered from the complexity of concurrent programming (through structured concurrency) but also take advantage of what Project Loom has to offer in Java 21+.
In this talk, we will introduce how to program using Direct Style in Scala 3 and some of the facilities it offers that goes above and beyond what other languages can provide.  Furthermore, Direct Style in Scala makes functional programming more approachable and is an alternative to monadic effect that we all love to hate.
